1. Using loops we can execute a block of code repeatedly

2. Python support 3 types of loops
    1. For loop    ==> for loop Iterate based on range
    2. While loop  ==> while loop Iterate based on condition
    3. nested loop ==> If a loop contains another loop that is called nested loop

3. Loop statements 
    1. break     ==> break used to terminates the loop
    2. continue  ==> continue used to skip the current iteration 
    3. pass      ==> 
        1. pass will do nothing 
        2. we use pass when statement is require to aviod syntax issues.
